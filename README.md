# Trip Advisor (the travel API used in this app isnt working anymore!!!!)

This is a website like trip advisor, coded with Reactjs and Material UI (+axios and context API).

You can search for restaurants, sites and hotels by entering a city name. (you MUST enter a correct city name and you need VPN if you live in certain places)

(Here is a link to a video of this project since the api endpoint isnt working anymore: https://www.instagram.com/dorsa.webdev)
